My "why" Statement

1.) Reflect on my career goals: What do I want to achieve? What impact do I want to make?
I want to achieve success in whatever software development position I end up in. My definition of success is to be a crucial, "can't live without" part of a team of like-minded people. I want to be reliable and display a "can-do" attitude, as well as practice good work ethics. I want to impact my future workplace by making everyone around me better. I don't know exactly how that would look, but that will be something I strive for.

2.) Identify my strengths and skills: What am I good at? What unique abilities do I bring to the table?
I am good at team work, communication, collaboration, time-management. I believe my experience in multiple industries (food, retail, medical, driving) has given me insights into the workplace that others may not have.

4.) Consider my passions and values: What hobbies or interest do I have? What problems do I care about solving?
I enjoy listening to, playing, and making music. I also like technology. I like to learn about and use new tech. A problem that I care about solving is making people's work life less stressful.

5.) Write a personal mission statement: Once you have reflected on your values, strengths, passions, and impact, consider writing a personal missions statement that encapsulates your "why". your mission statement should be brief, clear, and compelling, capturing your purpose and motivation.
