for the second part of part 2 of this exercise, I need to I need to do the following:
    2. Make a request to the deck of cards API to request a single card from a newly shuffled deck. (DONE) Once you have the card, make a request to the same API to get one more card from the **same** deck. (DONE)
        Once you have both cards, ***console.log*** the values and suits of both cards.
    
    I need to use promise.all for this.
    So i need to turn both of my requests into variables that I can call in promise.all
    Afterward I need to console.log the suit and value of the cards that were drawn
