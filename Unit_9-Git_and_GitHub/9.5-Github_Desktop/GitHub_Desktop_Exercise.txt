GitHub Desktop Exercise

3.) Initialization
I created a repo by selecting file>new repository
It was automatically staged
I committed the changes by adding a commit message and clicking commit to master

4.) Staging and committing
I created a file called journey.txt by navigating to my GitHub folder in file explorer and creating a new file within that folder.
I staged the changes by clicking Fetch origin in GitHub Desktop
I committed my changes buy adding a commit message and clicking commit to master.

5.) Deletion
I created a file called temp.txt within my GitHub folder in File Explorer
I wrote "This file is meant to be deleted" within that file.
I then deleted the file and followed the stage and commit process within GitHub Desktop

6.) Renaming
I changed the name of journey.txt to adventure.txt within the File Explorer
I then updated the content of that file to "My journey evolves into an adventure with Git".
I then followed the stage and commit process in GitHub Desktop

7.) Ignoring Files
I don't know how to do this in GitHub Desktop so I will come back to this when I have learned how.

8.) Diving Deeper
I changed the content of adventure.txt to "Exploring the depths of Git commands and their powers".
I viewed the changes in GitHub Desktop
I then followed the stage and commit process in GitHub Desktop

9.) History and Restoration
I'm not sure how to accomplish this process in GitHub Desktop. I will update this exercise when i have learned how.
