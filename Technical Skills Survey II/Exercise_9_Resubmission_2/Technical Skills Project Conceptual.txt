Technical Skills Project Conceptualization

1.) So for the first step I need to write a function that will turn a plaintext message into an encrypted message. I need to be able to do this with any given shift value. On top of that I need a function that will add a random letter after every second letter of the message and I need non-alphabetical characters to be left in the encrypted message unchanged.

2.) For the second step I need to reverse everything I just did with the encryption function. So I need a function that will change the message back into plain text with non-alphabetical characters left unchanged. Further, I need to remove all of the random letters that were inserted during the encryption process.

3.) My encryption and decryption functions need to be able to account for large shift values. So I need code to account for that in both the encryption and decryption processes. 

The logic is quite simple. Implement an encryption function that a.) changes a plaintext message into an encrypted one b.) adds a random letter after every two letters c.) accounts for large shift values.

For the decryption process I need to a.) change an encrypted message into the  original plaintext b.) remove all the random letters c.) accounts for large shift values.


After having written the code, I keep running into the same problem and that has to do with the decryption process. I can encrypt while adding random letters and accounting for large shift values just fine. But when I decrypt the message that was encrypted, I don't get the original message. The problems I've run into specifically are that the decryption will remove the wrong letters. So instead of the "This is a test!" I'll get something like "Thmlsxios t yesit!".
