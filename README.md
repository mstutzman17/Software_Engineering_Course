The following is an organized organized list of the files and folders that I will create and work on throughout the Sprindgboard Software Engineering Course. Everything is organized by Unit Numbe and Unit Name, and Subunit Nunmber and Subunit Name. For example:
I'm currently working in Unit_11_Intermediate_JavaScript. The Unit number is 11 and the Unit Name is Indtermediate JavaScript
If you open Unit_11_Intermediate_JavaScript you will find the subunit numbers and names organized in the same way.
11.4_Intro_to_Data_Structures is Subunit number 11.4 and subunit name Intro to Data Structures.
