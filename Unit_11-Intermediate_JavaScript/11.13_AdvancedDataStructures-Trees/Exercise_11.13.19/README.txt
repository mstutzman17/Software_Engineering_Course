This code consisits of multiple JS files that each have a BST class and a Node Class, as well as 1 or 2 methods written inside the BST class. Thery are listed in this text file in no particular order.

1. InsertAndFind.js: consists of the code for the iterative versions of the insert and find methods.
2. RecursiveInsertAndFind.js: has the code for the recursive versions of the insert and find methods.
3. dfsPreOrder.js: contains a DFS, Pre Order traversal method.
4. dfsInOrder.js: contains a recursive version of the DFS, In Order traversal method.
5. dfsPostOrder.js: contains a DFS, Post Order traversal method.
6. breadthFirstSearch.js: contains a BFS Method
7. remove.js: contains the remove method
8. isBalanced.js: contains a method to check if a BST is balanced or not
9. findSecondHightest.js: contains the method to find the second highest node in BST
10. iterativeDFSInOrder.js: contains an iterative depth first, in order traversal of a BST


Each JS file exports both the BST class (with its subsequent method(s)) and the Node class to index.html.
